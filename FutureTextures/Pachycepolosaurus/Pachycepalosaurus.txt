How big is it? Cow sized? A little bigger than pawns?
What does it eat? (is it a predator?)  Herbivore, low plants.
Where does it live? Same as triceratops.
Does it spawn in packs? Small groups.
Other info-- good pets? shearable? do you want it to have a specific type of leather? etc. "Armored" leather maybe. Can we make them headbutt each other sometimes?

Pachycephalosaur (meat)
