How big is it? 3x-ish pawn size?
What does it eat? (is it a predator?) Predator, will "wrap" prey and swallow it? (Will at least have the swallow thing via Sarg's code)
Where does it live? Tropical jungles.
Does it spawn in packs? Nope, spawns alone.
Other info-- good pets? shearable? do you want it to have a specific type of leather? etc. Gives snakeskin if that's a vanilla thing, if not it gives medium leather.
