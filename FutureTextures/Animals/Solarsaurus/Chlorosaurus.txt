How big is it? About half the size of the normal dilophosaurus
What does it eat? (is it a predator?) Predator but will gladly eat meat or scavenge.
Where does it live? Chromatic Oasis
Does it spawn in packs? Yes, alone or in mated pairs.
Other info-- good pets? shearable? do you want it to have a specific type of leather? etc. Hunt smaller prey. Makes for a neat pet since you hardly have to feed it.
