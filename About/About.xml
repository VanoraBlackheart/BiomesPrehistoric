Biome! Prehistoric brings to life a plethora of prehistoric plants and animals, with over 60 different species of prehistoric creature, we fill each and every biome with new plants and animals, even more with Biomes! Islands! Each and every vanilla biome has been given an overhaul of new life.

While realism is the general goal for much of the creature art in this mod, some liberties are taken on a few for the sake of the "Rule of cool."

The rapid and unexpected re-terraforming of the Rimworld was nearly catastrophic for its various humanoid denizens, but its aftermath came with even more surprises. Gone were the majority of the species to which they had grown accustomed, instead they came to soon encounter many new species that had been extinct for many millennia back on Earth, brought back to life by the will and whim of an unfathomable Archotech.


DETAILS
- Over 50 new land animals
- Over 10 new aquatic animals
- 4 new Pterosaurs
- Over 80 new prehistoric plants
- A full soundtrack of prehistoric-themed music by Dendroid
- Multiple dinos can be used as pack animals
- Most dinos can be trained to various capacities
- All dinos lay eggs, with Compies able to lay unfertilized eggs
- All three types of raptor can be sheared for Proto-Feathers, a type of "wool"
- Some dinos give special trophy items when butchered, such as the T-rex
- Baby dinos can spawn in the wild
- Some dinos pack-hunt. (This includes your poor innocent colonists)
- Some dinos are piscivores and will eat fish from water tiles (They will hunt normally when they cannot access water)


3 mod options to customize your prehistoric content:
- Animals Only: Adds Dinos but NOT plants to the world
- Animals and Plants: Adds Dinos and Prehistoric plants to the world
- Prehistoric World: Makes ONLY prehistoric plants and animals spawn in the wild.
