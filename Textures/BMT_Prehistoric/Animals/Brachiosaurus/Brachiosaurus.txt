How big is it? At least 2x the size of thrumbo?
What does it eat? (is it a predator?) Eats trees primarily, will decrease their growth % rather than eat it entirely.
Where does it live? Warmer forested biomes, and arid shrubland maybe.
Does it spawn in packs? Yes, small to medium sized herds. 
Other info-- good pets? shearable? do you want it to have a specific type of leather? etc. Very durable leather that retains heat well. Not very beautiful.
