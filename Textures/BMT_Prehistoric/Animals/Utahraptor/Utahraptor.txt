How big is it? A little bigger than pawns.
What does it eat? (is it a predator?) Predator.
Where does it live? Arid shrubland and desert, most commonly if there is a river.

Other info-- good pets? shearable? do you want it to have a specific type of leather? etc. Hunts in packs... sort of. When one of their species attacks a nearby animal, the rest will follow suit.
