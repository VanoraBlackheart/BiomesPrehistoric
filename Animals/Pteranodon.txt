How big is it? A bit bigger than wargs?
What does it eat? (is it a predator?) Piscivore, "fishes" in water tiles like Spino?
Where does it live? All biomes with LAKE OR OCEAN tile next to it. 
Does it spawn in packs? Maybe.
Other info-- good pets? shearable? do you want it to have a specific type of leather? etc. Gives a weak leather, tends to flee rather than fight.
